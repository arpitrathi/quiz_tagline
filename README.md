Timer based quiz
Currently the tags are statically fetched in the portal.
To play the game, clone this code and run on the browser.
Start the game and timer will run for 30 seconds. In that time you have to answer 6 questions. 
There is no back button. So once you answer a question, you will have no option to revert back to the last question. 
The game will end when either you have submitted all the answers and you called end game or the timer runs out of time.After that the tags and the answer given will be shown on the screen. You can match the questions with their answers from your list, and  can judge the result.

#TODO1: Match the answers with the list and display the final result without manually verifying the answers.
